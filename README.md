# Duolight Sphere Visualiser
Currently experimenting and beginning my journey with Three.js and wanted to play around with 3D shapes starting with something basic yet versatile (sphere). This is a fun and great way to learn about light sources and where shadows fall on a sphere. You can read a basic how to use below or you start experimenting straight away. There are also examples of colour schemes that you can start to play around to create exciting depths and colour combinations to achieve your ideal theme/vibe. Enjoy!

## How to use

The visualiser opens with a default red and cyan light where red is at the top and cyan at the botton. By clicking on the red or cyan tab, you can freely experiment with the position of the light source on a X, Y and Z axis while changing their colours (+intensity) to suit your taste. By adjusting to the tabs, you can create the look of only using one light source. (Note: the default texture map on the sphere is similar to a golf ball and can't be changed and the default point light is of a cyan shade)

Once you are done experimenting or setting up your sphere, you can close the control menu and interact with it as you wish.
